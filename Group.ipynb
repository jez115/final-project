    "To us, the best neighborhood would be safe, fun, and clean. To find which neighborhood best meets these qualities, we looked at crime activity, fire incidents, frequency of smart trash cans, and number of playgrounds in each of those neighborhoods because these are things that heavily impact quality of life of the families living there. \n",

    "**The Best Neighborhood**: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",

    "<u>Emily's conclusion<u: _My favorite neighborhoods is Shadyside, which I love because of the amount of boba and matcha shops. Unfortunately, Shadyside is one of the neighborhoods with the greatest amount of crime and fire incidents, so I would not want to live there. I think it is better for just visiting._"
