    "Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.\n",
    "    Cleanliness is very important in the quality of a neighborhood as it showcases the care for surroundings the community has and benefits the citizens with a calming and clean environment. I also explored taxes to see how money was going toward things in the communities and how affordable it is to live in different neighborhoods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?\n",
    "    I am measuring the amount of smart trash cans found throughout different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. This can signify how cleanly areas are depending on how many trash cans they have, because it can help prevent litter and also encourage proper disposal of trash.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this."
